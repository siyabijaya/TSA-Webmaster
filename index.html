                <div class="box">Once upon a time there lived 2 friends who lived right next door to each other. They never fought and they did everything together. One day they met a boy at the park and then he said "your fat" to the short girl and then the tall girl punched the fat boy because she always has her best friend's back even though she is fat.</div>
