                <td><div>Bombay Bliss was inspired from the childhoods of co-founders Bijaya and Nadgonde who were best friends living in the bustling city of Bombay. Their experiences in the streets of their homeland led to the idea of creating a sustainable and eco-friendly restaurant together in order to raise awareness to protecting the environment. Together, they share their heritage through cooking vegan/vegetarian Indian cuisine that nourishes the mind, body, and soul. By partering with local organic farms, the best friends make the first step into a more sustainable and healthy world.</div></td>
